# central-cinema

A BYU student project. Expands on the idea for a one-stop-shop for all your streaming needs.

## Overview

This was a project I created with a partner for a UX design class during my senior year at college. 
At the time, I had this idea rolling around in my head for a centralized movie streaming platform which basically scraped data from all the other streaming services
(Netflix, Hulu, Amazon) and put it in one place. Gone would be the days of having to go into each app individually to see if the show you wanted was available. 
In theory, all you'd have to do is log into central cinema, search for what you want to watch,  click it, and boom! You either would get taken to the place where
you could watch it or you could just stream it right there. I think the idea was also to have some kind of Oauth thing going on so you wouldn't have to sign in to
different services all the time either. 

As far as the assignment. I believe it was to just have a few UX flows through our app. It didn't have to be functional or anything. And, obviously, it had to look decent. That's funny because looking at this now I'm not sure we hit that second point! My skills in web development have increased significantly since then. 

I'm updating this readme as part of an effort to have more.... presentable things on my GitHub account instead of just test after test after test for experiment after experiment. Feel free to download and try this one out.
